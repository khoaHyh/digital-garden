# My Digital Garden

Can't stop re-creating my personal website 🙃

## Why 🤷🏻‍♂️

Getting tired of catering personal website to show off only programming and career stuff. I think vintage internet is making a comeback and I'd like to be apart of the renaissance/revival. As such, I'm also straying away from SPAs and JS frameworks for this one and going with a new stack: Go, Templ, HTMX. Basically serving markup from the server. Super interested in Hypermedia, HATEOAS, and [mcmaster](https://www.mcmaster.com/).
