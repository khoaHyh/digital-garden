# My Digital Garden

Can't stop re-creating my personal website 🙃

## Why 🤷🏻‍♂️

Straying away from SPAs and JS frameworks for this one and trying out Go, Templ, and HTMX. Basically serving markup from the server. Creating a digital garden while learning about Hypermedia and HATEOAS.

## TODOs

- [] add more to readme
- [] make entire open source contribution component clickable
- [] add github links for projects
- [] make dotted line for project card hover a different colour (currently black)
- [] add technology tags to project cards (maybe)
