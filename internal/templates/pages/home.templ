					<div class="space-y-4 text-secondaryText">
						<p>
							Started as a pedicab driver in Toronto, biking people around the city and discovering 
							stories from all walks of life. When I wanted to start my own pedicab company, 
							I needed a website but couldn't afford to hire someone.
						</p>
						<p>
							Black Friday 2019: bought a web development course on Udemy. Little did I know this 
							would completely change my career trajectory.
						</p>
						<p>
							The pandemic hit in March 2020. While the world paused, I dove deeper into programming. 
							Completed CS50, built projects, struggled through algorithms, and fell in love with 
							the craft of building software.
						</p>
						<p>
							May 2021: landed my first developer role at TouchBistro. Got plopped onto the Menu Management
							team building a Cloud-first menu that interacts with in-venue POS systems ü•≥.
